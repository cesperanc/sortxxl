# Introduction #
  * Implementation of the bitonic sort algorithm in CUDA
  * Construction of a dataset with random numbers to sort in CUDA
  * Using a dataset from a file
  * Output  the sorted data into a file
  * WebSocket and Web server implementation to show the benchmark results in realtime on a Web Browser (demo mode)

The project was developed within the course of High Performance Computing at the Computer Engineering Master - Mobile Computing at [School of Technology and Management](http://www.estg.ipleiria.pt/) of [Polytechnic Institute of Leiria](http://www.ipleiria.pt/).

The code was written in C and designed to run on a Linux machine with cuda compatible hardware.
